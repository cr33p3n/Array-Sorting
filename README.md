# Example of array sorting in C++

This project demonstrates an example of array sorting in C++ using the bubble sort algorithm. The program fills an array with random numbers, sorts it, and outputs the sorted array.

## How it works

1. **Filling the array**: The array is filled with random numbers
2. **Sorting the array**: A bubble sort algorithm is used to order the elements of the array.
3. **Array output**: The sorted array is output to the screen.

## Build and Run

1. **Clone repository**:
   ``sh
   git clone https://github.com/cr33p3n/Array-Sorting.git
   cd array-sorting
